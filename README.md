# LOGOServer

An application designed for Raspberry Pi which listens for LOGO commands and converts them to GPIO output, which controls two motors

# Dependencies

This application uses pi4j to control the GPIO pins. I have not included included it in this project, but it can be downloaded from http://www.pi4j.com. You will need to create a lib folder next to the src folder and copy pi4j-core.jar into it
